Subject: [PATCH 3/4] <machine/stdint.h>: Add two basic LP types.

 These will be used to derive types that depend on data type models.
 On x64_64 is is very simple.  Non ILP32/LP64 model usage on UNIX-like
 systems is rather exception.  For example if we would support LLP64
 data type model, we would declare these types as follows:
   typedef long long __bslp_t;
   typedef unsigned long long __bulp_t;
